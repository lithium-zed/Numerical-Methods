For Numerical Methods CLE.
This program can get the estimated roots of a function using the following methods:
 Bisection,
 Secant,
 Doolittle Method,
 Gauss-Seidel,
 Simpson 1/3 Rule

 As of current development: 
 The FunctionReader class and algorithm could not read complex functions or nested functions such as sin(x+1) or e^x^2.
